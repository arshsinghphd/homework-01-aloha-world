How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 3

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what
capacity. 

Parker McKillop and Dipen Modi helped me set up my IntelliJ IDEA by asking questions to narrow the issues.
  
Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)

* I needed help for working with ItelliJ IDE: google/gemini and IntelliJ IDEs in-built Learn Module. 
    [1] Google LLC, *Gemini*, Generative AI. Accessed via Safari Browser, Jan. 16, 2026. Available: https://google.com/.
    [2] JetBrains, *IntelliJ Learn*, integrated learning environment within IntelliJ IDEA. Accessed via IntelliJ IDEA IDE, Jan. 16, 2026.
* I used ChatGPT to learn how to write List\<int\> in memaid classDiagram (as List~int~).
* I used Java Documentation to learn about sytax, cited in the Report.md

(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?

* Building a new class based on hits from Javadoc and tests. 

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?

* I think there are some mismatches in the toString JavaDoc and test that could be fixed.
* The GreetingTest was also missing two imports, 
(but I am not sure if this was a source issue or one of my own 
push/pull mismatch due to being new at IntelliJ's commit amend.)
  * import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
  * import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
* I would remove the style checks requirements for the first assignment of the semester where many are using Java for the first time.
